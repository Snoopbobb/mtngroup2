 <p>
	I'm sure you already know what side of the debate I'm going to be on concerning this issue, but let's delve into
this anyways.  Using "build-your-own-website" companies is a great idea.  Wait, what?  Yes, I believe that they are
a great idea.  They are much cheaper, they can be more convenient, and their technology gets better as the years go.
I also believe that working on your own car is a good idea too.  Some people like tearing out their own kitchens and
rebuilding them just the way they want it.  I mean afterall, DIY network makes it look soooo easy.  Some even believe
in using home medicine over doctor visits.</p>
	<p>However, I also know people who are very hesitant to attempt to fix their own cars, houses, or health when they 
get sick.  The decision depends on a number of things.  How much you want to spend, how much time you have to build your 
own site, and how important your site is to you.  If I were to be lucky enough to own a Lamborghini, I don't think I 
would be putting new brakes on it myself.  I would probably get my money and go visit the dealership and make them take
care of that.  Now if your goal of your site is to serve family and friends, build your own sites are the best.  If you 
have a sales goal in the thousands of dollars per month or want site traffic in the thousands per month, the build your own 
site might not be the best idea.</p>
	<p>Let's look at a few cons for building sites yourself.  First, there can be a steep learning curve with some build your 
own services.  Also, build your own sites usually don't do well with something that is a very popular acronym in the web 
world, SEO.  SEO is Search Engine Optimization, yeah I'll stick to typing SEO.  SEO is what allows search engines, think 
Google and Bing, into first seeing your site, and then ranking it against terms that people use to search for other sites.  
I'll leave my long SEO theory and description for another article, sorry to disappoint you.  What I will tell you about the 
search engines though is that they are quite picky.  They look for structure in your code and love seeing properly coded 
sites so that they can make sense of them.  The build you own sites can fail in this area.  Their main goal is to try and make 
it easy for the user to throw together a site without learning any code.  This can cause your user built site to go unnoticed
or recieve a poor ranking compared to professionaly built sites with proper coding.</p>
	<p>Another clue I see about build your own sites failing, is when a site is "RIP'd" on the internet.  You may come across sites
that look like they are from a different era.  A good clue is to scroll down to the footer and see copyright 2001.  This is
the year the site died and unfortunately a lot of them are build your own.  There could be different reasons for this, a failed 
business, a failed site, or even a failed build your own service.  Why are they dead?  Maybe it's the lack of SEO, maybe the 
owner became to busy to try and update it, but I have another idea.  The DIY syndrome.  This happens to good people with good
intentions.  It's the couple that decides to put an addition on their house by themselves only to find themselves living with 
sawdust and plastic drapes everywhere years after the work began.  The contractor that puts additions in everyday knows how to 
do this correctly and can do it faster than the couple ever could, even if they do watch DIY network.  Your website is the 
same way.  The do it yourselfer of the web can spend a lot of time getting their site just right, along comes an update to the 
build your own service and suddenly there's a death.  Everything they perfected with their site is now broken and all the work 
they put in raising their site from a seedling is gone. So people get tired of dealing with it, they leave their site alone on 
the web, it's carcass a reminder to others about the bad things that can happen to the DIY crowd.</p>
	<p>What it comes down to in this decision is wether you are technically savvy, that you have a lot of time to learn the 
build your own site service your using, have the time to update it, keep it working, and can troubleshoot problems when they
arise.  Most do it yourself website building companies are all different from each other and learning one won't have anything 
to do with the others.  The other option would be to invest some money into your site and hire a professional.  Someone who can 
give you what you need and they can worry about these problems while you watch the DIY network.</p>
	<p>One thing to remember though.  When you make the decision to hire a professional web designer, you should get what you 
pay for.  Your site should make you happy, look professional, and work.  It should drive your business, your ideas, give the 
users a friendly, enjoyable experience, and it should more than pay for itself in a very short time.  There is an old adage 
that comes up a lot in life.  "You get what you pay for."  If you are using a free or inexpensive site building service don't 
expect your site to compete with the likes of Amazon.com.  If you use a web professional though, watch out Amazon!</p>
	<p>Well, thanks so much for reading.  Please leave a comment below if you'd like, but do take care and have a great day.</p>

 Making Mole Hills Out of Mountains
</h1>
 <h3 style="align-text: center;">

 <p>
	Now don’t believe everything you read on Wikipedia, but it tells me that Reinhold Messner is the greatest mountain
 climber in history.  He climbed his first summit with his strict father at the age of 5.  He became one of Europe’s 
 best climbers during his early twentys.  Later, he went on to become the first person in history to climb to the top 
 of Mt. Everest without the aid of oxygen.  A feat that doctors and other climbers around the world said could never be
 done.</p>
	<p>So what does Reinhold have to do with me, you, or this site?  Well, frankly I thought it would be fitting to have a
mountain climber story for the blog's first post on The MTN Group’s website, also he got me thinking about what possesses
people to achieve things that people say can never be done.  It’s what makes us humans great.  It’s what makes starting a
business great.  It’s hard work, it’s rewarding, and it’s frightening.</p>
	<p>In October of 2011, I was laid off from my posh engineering job after working there for over 11 years. It didn’t come
as a total shock, the housing downturn had lent it self to that bad feeling, but it still punched my family and me in the
gut.  On my last day, I walked out of there thinking that I would easily find a new job.  Well, I slowly came to the
realization that it wasn’t going to be that easy, not even close.  Oh I had some close calls, some near hits, but I could
never get anyone to take me on.</p>
	<p>I began helping my wife do her courier route last summer.  It’s a driving job across some of the most beautiful parts
of Colorado.  It’s 90 miles round trip everyday and after a week, it’s not very fun.  However, I made a new friend during
these lonely trips through the mountains.  Dave Ramsey, a national radio host with a hate for debt and a get off your lazy
butt and make something of yourself attitude.  I heard unemployed caller after unemployed caller, telling their pitiful 
stories.  Instead of pity they got a verbal swipe at their backside telling them to start a business, mowing lawns, 
power washing, painting.  “Find something your good at and start making money doing it!, ” Dave would tell them.  “Are you
tech savy?,”he would ask a caller, “Yeah, a little.” “Well than buy some books and start a web design business!”  “I should 
do that,” I would always think, “but it’s too hard and I’ve never ran a business.”</p>
	<p>Finally, one day on the mountain, I got fed up.  This job was a pain, it wasn’t paying the bills, and I wasn’t going to
be doing this for the rest of my life, at least not without a fight.  So I took Dave’s advice. I got home and took the family
to the bookstore and bought some books on web design and books on how to run a business.  These last few weeks I’ve had my 
books at my side, and I’ve been studying other websites and watching hours worth of videos on how to code websites and get 
them running.  Now it’s time to take what I've learned and put it to work.</p>  
	<p>I imagine Reinhold Messner and his first climb at the age of five.  Looking down across the world, his first taste, and
maybe too young to realize his life's passion. He went higher than anyone without any aid.  Well, this is my new passion, 
and I'm going to do all I can to provide my customers with great service and to help them reach their goals.  Let us help 
you make your dreams a reality, and achieve your goals as Reinhold Messner did.  Welcome to The MTN Group.</p>
